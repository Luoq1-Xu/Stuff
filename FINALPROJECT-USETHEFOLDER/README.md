# BASED BALL : A baseball at-bat simulator
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Based Ball is a simple simulator that allows you to face off against two pitchers: Chris Sale (Left hand pitcher) and Jacob Degrom (Right Hand pitcher).
The art of pitching has long fascinated me, and so I wanted to create a simple simulator that allows people to experience what it is like to step into the box and face
some good pitching. I had a few preliminary thoughts:
- I will need many different functions for various purposes.
- How to simulate the flight path of the ball visually?
- How to check for the bat path, both timing and location?
- How will the Graphical User Interface be set up?
- and many many more....

Not to get ahead of myself,
