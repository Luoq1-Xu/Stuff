Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:As the number of simulations increased, it became evident that the top few teams were Belgium, Brazil,Portugal
Spain and Switzerland. These teams stay in the top few positions when number of simulations increased.
With a Small number of simulations, teams like France, Croatia and even Colombia were placed into the top few,
and this pattern did not hold as the number of simulations increase, as the "strong" teams such as Belgium will filter to the top.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
